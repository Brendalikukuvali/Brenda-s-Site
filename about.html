 <h2>Ways of visualizing beyond what see and experience </h2>
<ol> 
<li>By trying different ways of doing things  as when you are <br>faced with a particular problem you try to use all ways of solving it.<br> This is by using the solutions you have heard off and<br> the solutions you know. As we try to fight for our rights as women<br> and girls there are things that prevent us but this<br> should not make us lose hope such traditions and cultures, men<br> being considered superior but this should not make us feel like<br> giving up but it should motivate us to be more strong. In the book,<br> Born a Crime Trevor's mother gets pregnant and gets married <br>to a white man which was not allowed at all. <br>She knew very well that there were consequences for engaging in a <br>relationship with a white man.  She gave birth to <br>Trevor and taught him both african and the white culture.</li>
<li>By beginning to live as if we have succeeded in your goal,<br> this can be achieved by always being positive in life.This will give us <br>the courage to continue struggling until we achieve our goals <br>and dreams in life. As women and girls we should consider ourselves as successful<br> people and this will give us the courage we need to <br>continue fighting for gender equality </li>
<li>By using self-talk and affirmations, this will enable you to<br> always talk and think positively of yourself no matter the situation<br> you will be in. When you are stuck you just need to tell yourself<br> that ‘I can do this’ and definitely it will give you the <br>strength to push on until you reach your destination.</li>
<li>By putting  together a dream collage. This is where you have<br> a combination of dreams and writing them down and ensuring you are <br>working towards achieving them. It will enable you to stay<br> focused in order to ensure that your dreams come true. It will act<br> as a motivating factor that will always remind that there is <br>something you need to do for your dreams to come true. </li>
</ol>
